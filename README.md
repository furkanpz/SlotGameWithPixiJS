# Lair of Riches - HTML5 Slot Game Prototype

Lair of Riches is a 5x5 "Bonus Buy" slot game prototype developed with PixiJS (HTML5). This project showcases several features found in modern slot games, including a configurable RTP (Return to Player), an "Expanding Multiplier Wild" mechanic, and a complete, data-driven user interface flow.

This project marks my first comprehensive venture into game development. It has been a significant learning journey, covering everything from conceptualizing game mechanics to implementing the mathematical model into a functional UI. While it began as an amateur endeavor, the goal was to deliver a product that adheres to professional standards.
